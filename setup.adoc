== Overview
Documentation for the target machine where the performance tests would
run on.

=== Vagrant

* `vagrant destroy -f`
* `vagrant up`

=== First.

The current state is based on CentOS 7. Need to reconsider.


* ✅ Create a user `tmpt`
  ** The name `tmpt` is `(T)he (M)aven (P)erformance (T)esting`

* ✅ Install `hypefine` on the target Machine?
  ** How ? Download via wget?

* ✅ Install different JDK Versions on it?
  ** Should we improve `disco` tool to download JDK's?
  ** Should I use `sdk man`
  ** Should I use tool?

- ❌
- ✅

=== Maven Setup

* Download the Maven Distros

* Should I use the download approach of my `testing.sh` script?

=== Show Case

* Think about a graphical distribution?
