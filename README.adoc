= Performance Setup for Apache Maven

== Overview

The idea is to create a detailed performance testing setup to more detailed information
about performance of Apache Maven.


== State

It's just a Proof Of Concept

== Requirements

need to reconsider.

=== Ideas

Scenarios:

1. Multi Module Build setups with the following number of children:

 * 10 modules
 * 20 modules
 * 50 modules
 * 100 modules
 * 200 modules
 * 500 modules
 * 1000 modules
 * 2000 modules
 * 2200 modules
 * 2500 modules
 * 3000 modules
 * 4000 modules
 * 5000 modules
 * 10000 modules


Different

. `mvn clean`
. `mvn package`
. `mvn verify`

Different JDK versions
 - Maybe we should also make different JVM options?

Different Maven versions


=== TODO

* Current creation of the scenarios should be replaced with Java implementation.
* Find a way to produce a graphical view of the result?
* Check if we can precompile the tool maybe via GraalVM?
