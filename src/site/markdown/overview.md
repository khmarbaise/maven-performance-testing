# Overview

The basic idea is to create different scenario for building project to
identify particular areas of Apache Maven to see the performance for those
areas from a user perspective.

For example just run a simple `mvn clean` which could be used to identify
performance issue related to scanning of projects depending on the number
of the modules. etc.
